Functionality I plan to add so far:

report on where in page it was found:
add more than html/text ??? does this make sense ?
make it usable in the bash/normal command line
remove the http from the links, make it figure it out
multiple words ?
important: is it only looking for links in the main page, or on the subsequent aswell?
